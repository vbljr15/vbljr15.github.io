    <h1>Junior College</h1>
    <p>After one year of prep school. I was offered a basketball scholarship to play juco basketball at USC Salkehatchie. My freshman year was kind of up and down and I struggled adjusting to college and being away from home and my true sophomore year was taken away because of a knee injury I suffered early in the season. But honestly now that I think about it, it was really the best thing for me. Because the year after I had the best year of my life. I was averaging 20 points a game and had a whole bunch of division 1 schools calling me and recruiting me. By the end of the season I earned awards for the season. with one being named to the Junior College All-American team and First Team All-Conference. I graduated from USC Salkehatchie last spring and shortly after I narrowed my list of schools down and choose to finish my last two years of college here at the University of Maine. </p>
